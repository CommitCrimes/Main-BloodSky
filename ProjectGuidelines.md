3. **Create a Branch**
   - Create a new branch from the issue.

4. **Write Clear Commits**
   - Commit frequently and make your messages as **descriptive** and **concise** as possible.
   - Use imperative tone in commit messages (e.g. `Add validation to login form`).

5. **Merge into `dev`**
   - Once your task is completed and tested:
     - **Merge your branch into `dev`**.
     - **Delete your feature branch** after merging.
     - Mark the issue as **Done**.
