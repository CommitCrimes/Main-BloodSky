# Project Contribution Guidelines

To ensure efficient collaboration and clean project organization, please follow the rules below when contributing to this project.

## Rules
### ðŸ“Š Excel Tracking is Mandatory
All tasks **must be recorded in the Excel tracking file**. Make sure to fill in **all necessary information**, including the **nature of the task**, the **estimated time**, and any **comments or context** that may be useful for tracking and planning. This helps us stay aligned, monitor progress, and report effectively.

### ðŸš¦ One Issue per Person Rule
To maintain clarity and avoid clutter, **each contributor can only have one open issue at a time**. This ensures better focus, improves communication, and prevents overlapping work. Once your current issue is marked as "Done", you can move on to the next task.


## ðŸ”§ Workflow

1. **Start with a Craft**
   - Before starting any task, create a "craft" (an initial idea or draft of the task).
   - Once you are ready to begin the work, convert it into an official **GitHub Issue**.
   - Don't forget to **assign it to yourself**.


2. **Detail the Task**
   - Add **comments or checklists** inside the issue to clarify the objective, steps, or expected outcomes if needed.

3. **Create a Branch**
   - Create a new branch from the issue.

4. **Write Clear Commits**
   - Commit frequently and make your messages as **descriptive** and **concise** as possible.
   - Use imperative tone in commit messages (e.g. `Add validation to login form`).

5. **Merge into `dev`**
   - Once your task is completed and tested:
     - **Merge your branch into `dev`**.
     - **Delete your feature branch** after merging.
     - Mark the issue as **Done**.

6. **Merging `dev` into `main`**
   - Only **Bellinna Uong** is allowed to merge `dev` into `main`.
   - Please **wait for her confirmation** before taking any action related to `main`.
